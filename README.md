# dotfiles

My personal configurations for emacs, vim, etc

This was started to help me remember how to set up new installations of things, and also as something to share with others who are starting to learn how to set up their machines for the first time for development.

Eventually I'd like to automate the installations but for now I've got examples of the configuration settings here in this repo.

# Notes

## Emacs
These settings are typically saved in ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el

## Vim
These settings are typically saved in ~/.vimrc
