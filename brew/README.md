# Installing Brew

On a fresh new mac osx, you can run this command to get brew

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Note that you should periodically update your brew indexes, which can be done with `brew update`


## Installing with Brew

It'll look like `brew install phantomjs` where the 3rd word is the package you want to install.

## Installing from a file

`cat list.txt | xargs brew install`
