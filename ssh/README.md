# Intro

SSH is used to access files on other machines, for example when you want to remotely log in or even copy files to/from git repositories (i.e. github, bitbucket).

# Getting your key


# Sharing your key

# Saving configurations to speed up access time

The settings are usually saved in a file located at `~/.ssh/config` where *config* is the filename (no file extensions).

Other files to know:

*known_hosts*

*authorized_keys*
