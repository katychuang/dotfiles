# Installing nixOS

Type in this command to get the latest version of nix:

`curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh`

It'll take a while for this to finish. When it stops, follow the directions about activating nix. It should look something like `. /Users/YOURUSERNAME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh` or you could also add it to your .profile to automatically run every time you start your machine.
